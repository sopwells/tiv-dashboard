title: "£71bn Lost: How UK Equity Funds Have Suffered a Decade of Outflows"
date: 2026-02-09
category: "UK Finance"
summary: "The UK is a leading research and data/tech start-up hub, but big finance has cost the UK a decade of growth as companies turn to the US and foreign investment to scale, leaving the UK without vital data and tech infrastructure."
commentary: "It's not just indexing and regulation that's killing our economy, it's big finance and their low appetite for risk coupled with short-term strategies. What's more risky: investing in a tech company or getting left behind in the global race for AI and data?"

This leaves the UK in a cycle of low growth and underinvestment in crucial sectors like tech and data, leading to a lack of infrastructure and lost opportunities as London loses relevancy.

With £11.1bn being withdrawn in 2025, just lower than 2023 and 2024, UK investors are tired of poor-performing funds. As one of London's few remaining listed tech/data companies, Wise looks into a dual listing in the US.

My opinion is that UK investors need to get much more familiar with data and tech and much better at evaluating risk. After all, what's more risky: investing in a tech company or getting left behind in the global race for AI and data?
