title: "£71bn Lost: How UK Equity Funds Have Suffered a Decade of Outflows"
date: 2026-02-09
category: "UK Finance"
summary: "The UK is a leading research and data/tech start up hub, but has few listed data and tech companies, especially when it comes to digital infrastructure
This has created a vacuum of opportunity for domestic retail investors who are tired of poor performing funds leading to £11.1bn being withdrawn in 2025, just lower than 2023 and 2024
Wise’s move to have a primary listing in US, continues a trend of companies looking for better tech literacy and therefore valuations amongst investing institutions
Fund managers should look to domestic tech and data companies if they want to entice investors and performance"
commentary: "The UK is therefore now in a cycle of low growth and underinvestment in crucial sectors like tech and data, meaning a lack of infrastructure and lost opportunities as London loses relevancy. It’s not just indexing and regulation that’s causing these outflows of retail investors, it’s big finance and their low appetite for risk coupled with short term strategies that make funds unappealing."

As one of London’s few remaining listed tech/data companies Wise moves to a dual listing with its primary listing in the US, my opinion is that UK investors needs to get more familiar with data and tech and better at evaluating risk, rather than using it as excuse not to move. After all, what’s more risky, investing in a tech company or getting left behind in the global race for AI and data?
