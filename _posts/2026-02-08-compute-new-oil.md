summary: "As AI models scale exponentially, compute infrastructure becomes the bottleneck. NVIDIA's dominance isn't just about chips—it's about ecosystem lock-in."
commentary: "The companies winning in AI aren't necessarily those with the best algorithms, but those with the most compute access."

Compute capacity has become the defining constraint in AI development. Companies that secured early access to NVIDIA's H100 and upcoming B200 chips are now months ahead of competitors.

This isn't just about hardware—it's about the entire software stack, tooling, and optimization techniques that come with it. The ecosystem lock-in is real and growing stronger.
